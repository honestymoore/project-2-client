# Call of Duty 
Welcome! 
For my full-stack application, I have created a gun tracker based off Call of Duty: Modern Warefare (COD). In this gun tracker, you can create a gun you may want in COD, and maybe you haven't unlocked it yet, you can add it to the tracker and it will show you the info on that gun until you delete it. This way, you can add all the guns you need to unlock before unlocking the final gun you're wanting. Once finished, you can use it as reference while playing COD to unlock guns.

## Getting Started 
To get started here is the link.
 
Once opened, you can start by going to your desired gun in game, then come back to the page and fill out the gun form, and hit add. Once added, you can go back into the game and see which guns you need to unlock to get the gun you originally wanted. Then add these guns to the form as well. And finally, you can create a Loadout with these guns to keep track of each gun.
